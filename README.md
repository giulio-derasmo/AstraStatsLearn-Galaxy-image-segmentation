# [AstraStatsLearn] Galaxy image segmentation

University project at the course of Statistical Learning concerning **image segmentation** and object detection of **satellite images** of galaxies using different technique involving typical methods as Random Forest and KMeans, and neural networks like U-Net, Mask RCNN and DETR.

A full presentation is available [here](https://github.com/giulio-derasmo/AstraStatsLearn-Galaxy-image-segmentation/blob/main/ASTROSTATLEARN-presentation.pdf).

## The data

The Dataset is composed of three images (25000x25000 pixels) in FIT format, which allow to preserve the intensity of large images when imported and saved. The first image < img.fits > is the raw satellite image, then we have the < rms.fits > which is the error of the image, and < true.fits > which is the true segmentation.
In order to train the various model we split the images in patches of 256x256 pixels increasing the number of sample for our training.

## Pre-Processing

We use different technique to pre-process the images.
1. normalize the image using normalize of < astropy.visualization > library;
2. enhance the contrasts using FITS Liberator 3;
3. add rms to the image.

Below a slide of the different preprocess applied to a single patch:

## Models

The model we use are: 
- Astropy cleaning
- KMeans
- Random Forest
- U-Net
- Mask RCNN
- DETR

## Results

U-Net image segmentation result: example over single patch. For full evaluation look at the presentation.
